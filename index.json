The main objective of the treaty is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology and promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty also aims to achieve nuclear disarmament. It is the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. India is not signatories to the treaty. According to India, the NPT restricts the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967 with properly explaining the grounds on which the distinction is valid. India considers the NPT as a flawed treaty and it does not recognize the need for a universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment.",

On May 11, 1998, India successfully test-fired nuclear missile Shakti-I at the Pokhran Test Range of Indian Army in Rajasthan in an operation administered by late president and aerospace engineer Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.

It is mainly because Shiva is traditionally associated with Tamas, which represents night or darkness. Shiva is their source, but he does not have them. He is Shivam, means the purest. The darkness of tamas cannot reside in him, but he presides over it as its controller and lord. Thus, Shivaratri, or the night of Shiva, has symbolic significance. Shiva is the lord of the materiality of the universe. In the microcosm of a living being, he is the lord of the mind and body. Both are enveloped in darkness.Happy Maha Shivaratri \ud83d\udd31",

Our visits to the Sewa group where we would go and spend our time with those wonderful, talented kids who in there very innocence taught us what a fortunate life we are leading.Teaching them a productive skill,providing them digital literacy were some of the work we did there.Then from Sewa group to Grace Home NSS did not stop,we widened our affiliations to such organisations as more and more students joined this initiative.

In spite of various initiatives taken by our government to contain and overcome this crisis the people are anxious and insecure which disturbs our mental health.We as NSS volunteers could really make a difference by reducing anxiety and improving mental health of the people. This simple 3 step guide can help us to break the virus chain and combat this crisis. 1)\tInstil awareness:  The only way to contain the spread of virus is through social distancing and self-hygiene. The challenge is to make people understand how important hygiene measures and social distancing is. There is a need to create awareness across all levels so that it is practised wilfully and not as some government-imposed rule. 2)\tInstil faith: The biggest demon is the fear of the unknown. People are insecure. They succumb to fake social media news and messages. Efforts to inform the ignorant of the fake news and instil faith in them about the better tomorrow is important. 3)\tInstil positivity: it is the need of the hour. It is time to show empathy and concern and serve the people in need. Service in the form of aids, charity, volunteering as frontline fighters of COVID-19 , or simply video-calling and connecting to people who are lonely and in need of help. If each one of us can instil positivity in one needy family, we will go a long way in saving humanity.Stay Safe and Stay HappyDr Swati Sharma (@swati.sharma.921)Faculty Coordinator NSS JIIT#books #bookstagram #book #reading #booklover #bookworm #bookish #read #bookstagrammer #booknerd #bibliophile #bookaddict #instabook #booksofinstagram #love #bookshelf #bookaholic #libros #b #reader #instabooks #author #art #libri #booklove #bookphotography #literature #library #booklovers #bhfyp",

This meet provides the description for monetary and financial functioning of a country and globe. What is exactly money, how does it work, who creates it and do we really need it.

His exasperation is quite universal and emotions are relatable. His skyrocketing to stardom shone an unfavourable spotlight on\u00a0Italy\u2019s very strict citizenship rules. He represents the idea that hard work and determination gets you far in life. Even though he got layed off during the pandemic cutoffs, he didn't give up and continued making tiktok videos which later became a global sensation. Subsequently he was granted with Italian citizenship in August 2022.Kudos to him on his hard work, determination and go getting attitude \ud83d\udc4f",

She\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0created\u00a0a\u00a0name\u00a0for\u00a0herself\u00a0in\u00a0Hindi,\u00a0but\u00a0she\u00a0also\u00a0recorded\u00a0songs\u00a0in\u00a0over\u00a036\u00a0Indian\u00a0languages.Before mesmerizing the whole nation with her beautiful voice, the Nightingale of India had to come a long way and face many rejections, with some music directors even remarking her voice as \"too thin\".

After her father's death, Lata Mangeshkar was mentored by Ghulam Haider, who believed in her talent and singing. According to Lata, Haider showed complete faith in her talent. She even considered him as her Godfather.Apart from providing the people with masterpieces in the entertainment media, she brought the nation to tears, including the prime minister after singing the song \"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\" against the backdrop of Sino-Indian War in 1963. In 1974, she became the first Indian to perform at Royal Albert Hall, London. She\u00a0has\u00a0received\u00a0numerous\u00a0honours,\u00a0including\u00a0the\u00a0Padma\u00a0Bhushan,\u00a0Dadasaheb\u00a0Phalke\u00a0Award,\u00a0Padma\u00a0Vibhushan,\u00a0and\u00a0Bharat\u00a0Ratna.Even the Late Dilip Kumar once commented \"Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain\" that translates to \"Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God\".

The only reason why the British had to leave India, as confessed by British PM Atlee to JusticePB Chakraborty at the Raj Bhawan in 1956. At that time, Justice Chakraborty, who was then the acting Governor of Bengal, had a prolonged discussion regarding the fundamental factors that had led the British to quit India. We want to quote their conversation here as told by Justice Chakraborty, who had written a letter to the publisher of RC Majumdar's book, A History of Bengal, in which he wrote:\"My direct question to Attlee was that since Gandhi's Quit India Movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they have to leave?In his reply, Attlee cited several reasons, the main among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British crown among the Indian Army and Navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji.No words or paragraphs can describe the work and contribution of Netaji Bose in our freedom struggle.",

He steered India through the rough coalition years of the Indian democracy and served as the PM not only once, but first for a period of 13 days, then 13 months, finally followed by a full five-year term. Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is known today for the Pokhran II nuclear tests which made India a full-fledged nuclear power and the glorious victory in the Kargil War of 1999. But very few people know that he was also a poet and a scholar. His speech possessed such articulation skills that even opposition leaders couldn\u2019t help but toe their own party lines to support him. He was a true patriot and reformer and dreamt of a shining India, a dream shared by million others. Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has left an indelible mark on Indian politics, and the ideals that he stood for and the principles he upheld still continue to inspire us.",

Born in a humble family on October 2, 1904, he was a man of principles and always righteous in his cause. Due to his dedication to the nation, he quickly rose to high positions of power and held various ministries before finally becoming the second Prime Minister of India in 1964.Shastri\u2019s thoughts were greatly inspired by Swami Vivekananda and he was a staunch patriot who knew the soul of India inside-out. _\u201cJai Jawan, Jai Kisan\u201d_, the slogan he gave very accurately sums up his legacy. He promoted the green revolution, the white revolution and guided India to a proud victory in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965.",

Our generation grew up watching Ganesha in childhood movies and cartoons, and a lot of us hold him in affection. The books contains a lot of pictures of Ganesha's depictions in architecture and scriptures and it's very interesting to note just how many lives have been touched by Ganesha's legacy .The book is actually a multidimensional study of Ganesha's impact on the people, leaning it more towards sociology than religion. It's an informative book, so we wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for preaching or self help. However, those interested in reading about the history, legends and stories associated with Ganesha, along with archeological evidences of his devotees thrown in will find this book a perfect match.\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udde1#GaneshaChaturthi #Festival #LordGanesha #Books #BookReview #jiit #Pts",

We all grew up hearing the age-old story. When Lord Krishna told the people of Mathura to worship Govardhan Hill, as it provided them and their cattle with food and resources, it angered Lord Indra. As a punishment, he made it rain for 7 days straight. To save the people, Lord Krishna raised Govardhan Parvat on his finger to provide shelter to the people. The day he dropped the mountain back after Lord Indra apologized, marks the day we all know and celebrate as Govardhan Puja. It is also called \u201cAnnakut\u201d or the day their food bearing mountain was saved.On this day, people worship Lord Krishna, Goddess Annapurna (the goddess of food) as well as the holy cow. Traditionally, 56 types of foods are prepared this day and the gods are served first. Cows are garlanded and idols of Lord Krishna are made. People also keep pots full of different kinds of food grains.",

Every one of our's life has come to a standstill in this pandemic and we all are in dire need to understand how our mind is reacting to this situation. This is where our recommendation of this month comes in, The book \"Everything is f*cked - A book about hope\" by Mark Manson will help you understand that how one can take care of himself in these trying times.Manson has constructed this book for a reader who feels like everything in life is worthless and those who are feeling terribly helpless can start to see the meaning in life. This book takes up several examples to illustrate what is being preached by the author. Also, the book allows one to retrospect his/her actions and helps them find hope.We believe that this pandemic is pushing all of our's limits and has affected millions of people's mental health, thus it was high time we helped you all find a read that is worth your time and suitable to the situation.Hoping every single one of you is doing Fine.\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab#ThePageTurnerSociety #Books #JIIT #PTS #hope #MarkManson #BookAboutHope #HappyReading #HappyThoughts #Reading #Retrospection",

What makes the movie work is the spectacular comic timing and performances of the lead actors. What also clicks is the balance the story manages to maintain between heart-warming emotions and dirtiness. The story develops at a decent rate, with enough suspense to keep you engaged and curious. Overall, the movie is loaded with some funny snippets and gags.

Now this gives us a good idea about how many authors are there in this field making it one of the most difficult tasks to pick up the author of the month in the area of suspense and thriller fiction. After reading the books of one of such quickly rising authors we found him - \"Blake Crouch\".Yes people we have chosen Blake as our Author of the Month and rightly so as his books have already been adapted into TV series and currently his book Dark Matter is being picturized by Sony Pictures. Blake started his career with 2 novels in 2004 and 2005 but what established him as a mystery author was his Wayward Pines Trilogy in 2012-14. Coming to his writing style, he is one of the best handlers of built-ups in books. When you start reading him, the beginning won't make sense but what would will amaze is you won't be able to keep Blake's book down and turns out it is the case all around the world. He weaves the story with such sophistication that the  person reading it is attached to it. They say- \"The historian records, but the novelist creates\" and trust us this what this author creates is worth recording.

The story revolves around the protagonist, a physics professor, who one day wakes up in a world where he is not an ordinary man. He is to identify if that's a dream or some other reality of his world and must find his way back to his wife and son. We all are aware of the great thrillers written by S.

To explore the mystery inside the caves , searching for the inner self and giving negativity a castaway. All the heart wants is a cabin by the lake, with the heartthrob by your side giving you the sweet headache.
