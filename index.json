She even considered him as her Godfather.\n\nApart from providing the people with masterpieces in the entertainment media, she brought the nation to tears, including the prime minister after singing the song \"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\" against the backdrop of Sino-Indian War in 1963. In 1974, she became the first Indian to perform at Royal Albert Hall, London. \n\nShe\u00a0has\u00a0received\u00a0numerous\u00a0honours,\u00a0including\u00a0the\u00a0Padma\u00a0Bhushan,\u00a0Dadasaheb\u00a0Phalke\u00a0Award,\u00a0Padma\u00a0Vibhushan,\u00a0and\u00a0Bharat\u00a0Ratna.\nEven the Late Dilip Kumar once commented \"Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain\" that translates to \"Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God\".

Born in a humble family on October 2, 1904, he was a man of principles and always righteous in his cause. Due to his dedication to the nation, he quickly rose to high positions of power and held various ministries before finally becoming the second Prime Minister of India in 1964.\nShastri\u2019s thoughts were greatly inspired by Swami Vivekananda and he was a staunch patriot who knew the soul of India inside-out. _\u201cJai Jawan, Jai Kisan\u201d_, the slogan he gave very accurately sums up his legacy. He promoted the green revolution, the white revolution and guided India to a proud victory in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965.", "datetime": "October 02, 2021"}, {"image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeblech/jpgram-cdn/main/images/thejaypeedebsoc/2021-09-30_06-07-31_UTC.jpg", "caption": "\"The power of speech is the ability to express a lot in a few words\"\n\nDo you enjoy speaking your mind and advocating for what you believe in?\nThen join us to do it with fun, knowledge, and a family!\n\nThe Jaypee Debsoc is elated to invite you all for the Orientation and Auditions for the session 2021-22\nDate for Orientation: 1st October 2021\nTime: 5 PM onwards\nVenue: G-Meet\n\nDates for Auditions: 3rd - 5th October 2021\nAll the other details will be shared on the WhatsApp group. \n.\nJoin the auditions group via the link provided in the Instagram bio, all the details will be given there. \n.\n*No prior experience required\n*Open for 1st and 2nd years\n*mode of audition: just a minute \n.\n\nexcited to see you in auditions!!", "datetime": "September 30, 2021"}, {"image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeblech/jpgram-cdn/main/images/thejaypeedebsoc/2021-09-28_07-14-16_UTC.jpg", "caption": "\u201cThose having torches will pass them on to others.\u201d \u2013 Plato\n\nAfter a wholesome year of debating, participations and magnificent successes, it is now time that the torch of leadership is passed on to the next line of budding debaters and leaders. \n\nThe Jaypee DebSoc is proud to announce the secretaries for the session 2021-22. \n\nModel United Nations - Akshay kumar and Gautam Kumar\n\nHindi Parliamentary Debates - Debdarshan Dutta and Saiantan Ghosh\n\nEnglish Parliamentary Debates - Rika Verma and Amish Mishra\n\nManagement and Technical Head - Vanshaj Jaiman\n\nAll the best to the new secretaries and wish them a year full of victories and success!", "datetime": "September 28, 2021"}, {"image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeblech/jpgram-cdn/main/images/thejaypeedebsoc/2021-09-28_07-10-42_UTC.jpg", "caption": "\u201cLeadership is an action, not a position.\u201d\nThe Jaypee DebSoc is proud to announce the President and Vice-President for the session 2021-22. \n\nPresident \u2013 Praseem Pramod Jaiswal\nVice-President \u2013 Divyansh Chauhan\n\nBoth of them have guided many students through the world of debating during their tenure as secretaries of the society during the session 2020-21.

As a punishment, he made it rain for 7 days straight. To save the people, Lord Krishna raised Govardhan Parvat on his finger to provide shelter to the people.

Now this gives us a good idea about how many authors are there in this field making it one of the most difficult tasks to pick up the author of the month in the area of suspense and thriller fiction. After reading the books of one of such quickly rising authors we found him - \"Blake Crouch\".\nYes people we have chosen Blake as our Author of the Month and rightly so as his books have already been adapted into TV series and currently his book Dark Matter is being picturized by Sony Pictures. \nBlake started his career with 2 novels in 2004 and 2005 but what established him as a mystery author was his Wayward Pines Trilogy in 2012-14. \nComing to his writing style, he is one of the best handlers of built-ups in books. When you start reading him, the beginning won't make sense but what would will amaze is you won't be able to keep Blake's book down and turns out it is the case all around the world. He weaves the story with such sophistication that the  person reading it is attached to it. They say- \"The historian records, but the novelist creates\" and trust us this what this author creates is worth recording. (as also proven by Sony Pictures and FOX \ud83d\ude1d)\n\nFind out some of his books in the link in bio! \n\nAlso let us know your favorite suspense thriller author in the comments... \ud83d\ude01\n\n#PageTurnerSociety #Books #JIIT #PTS #ThePageTurnerSociety #Thriller #Suspense #DarkMatter #Recursion #WaywardPines #BlakeCrouch #Readers #LoveToRead #LoveForReading #suspensebooks #Books #HappyReading", "datetime": "March 10, 2021"}, {"image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeblech/jpgram-cdn/main/images/thepageturnersociety/2021-03-04_09-02-37_UTC.jpg", "caption": "A book in the genre of Suspense and Thriller has to pass certain quality checks and we made sure that this time our Book of the month not only passed those but set the bar quite high up.

The story revolves around the protagonist, a physics professor, who one day wakes up in a world where he is not an ordinary man. He is to identify if that's a dream or some other reality of his world and must find his way back to his wife and son. \n\nWe all are aware of the great thrillers written by S. Sheldon, Agatha Christie, or Lee Child but it has been long since a new style from a budding author came out that had everyone glued to it and kept those pages turning by themselves till there were no more to go on.

It is made to be bigger because of increasing corona noise on social media. In spite of various initiatives taken by our government to contain and overcome this crisis the people are anxious and insecure which disturbs our mental health.\nWe as NSS volunteers could really make a difference by reducing anxiety and improving mental health of the people. This simple 3 step guide can help us to break the virus chain and combat this crisis. \n1)\tInstil awareness:  The only way to contain the spread of virus is through social distancing and self-hygiene. The challenge is to make people understand how important hygiene measures and social distancing is. There is a need to create awareness across all levels so that it is practised wilfully and not as some government-imposed rule. \n2)\tInstil faith: The biggest demon is the fear of the unknown. People are insecure. They succumb to fake social media news and messages. Efforts to inform the ignorant of the fake news and instil faith in them about the better tomorrow is important. \n3)\tInstil positivity: it is the need of the hour. It is time to show empathy and concern and serve the people in need. Service in the form of aids, charity, volunteering as frontline fighters of COVID-19 , or simply video-calling and connecting to people who are lonely and in need of help.
