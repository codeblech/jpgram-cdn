In spite of various initiatives taken by our government to contain and overcome this crisis the people are anxious and insecure which disturbs our mental health.We as NSS volunteers could really make a difference by reducing anxiety and improving mental health of the people. This simple 3 step guide can help us to break the virus chain and combat this crisis. 1)\tInstil awareness:  The only way to contain the spread of virus is through social distancing and self-hygiene. The challenge is to make people understand how important hygiene measures and social distancing is. There is a need to create awareness across all levels so that it is practised wilfully and not as some government-imposed rule. 2)\tInstil faith: The biggest demon is the fear of the unknown. People are insecure. They succumb to fake social media news and messages. Efforts to inform the ignorant of the fake news and instil faith in them about the better tomorrow is important. 3)\tInstil positivity: it is the need of the hour. It is time to show empathy and concern and serve the people in need. Service in the form of aids, charity, volunteering as frontline fighters of COVID-19 , or simply video-calling and connecting to people who are lonely and in need of help. If each one of us can instil positivity in one needy family, we will go a long way in saving humanity.Stay Safe and Stay HappyDr Swati Sharma (@swati.sharma.921)Faculty Coordinator NSS JIIT#books #bookstagram #book #reading #booklover #bookworm #bookish #read #bookstagrammer #booknerd #bibliophile #bookaddict #instabook #booksofinstagram #love #bookshelf #bookaholic #libros #b #reader #instabooks #author #art #libri #booklove #bookphotography #literature #library #booklovers #bhfyp",

His hesitancy with words taught him the power of saying more with less.So, in a gentle way, he shook the world with his words.This 2nd October, CICE wishes you to celebrate the  149th birthday of the epitome of non-violence and peace by instilling those qualities in ourselves and make the world, a better place to live in.",

The main objective of the treaty is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology and promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty also aims to achieve nuclear disarmament. It is the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. India is not signatories to the treaty. According to India, the NPT restricts the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967 with properly explaining the grounds on which the distinction is valid. India considers the NPT as a flawed treaty and it does not recognize the need for a universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment.",

Magic \u2728? Have you ever taken a look at compilers other than GCC or Microsoft Visual C/C++?Modern day production quality compilers are enormously complex pieces of software that require a lot of background knowledge to tinker with. This can make it daunting for newcomers like us to break into the field of compiler design. Join JODC + OSDC for a talk centred around few important questions such as: - Why are compilers important?- Where are they used?- How does a compiler break down code into machine instructions?This talk is for anyone who wants to know about compilers and about LLVM Open Source Compiler Infrastucture which powers various programming languages like C/C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift and more! \ud83d\ude0eDate: Wednesday, 24th August 2022Time: 10:00 P.M.Meet Link: https://meet.jit.si/OSDCMeetup (Online)Fill out the form: https://forms.gle/ByX3XdvDx8XAuZup6(Links in bio)",

On top of getting a clear idea of just what DevOps is about, you'll also learn about various DevOps processes like automation, CI/CD pipelines etc. followed by a practical demonstration of basic CI/CD pipelines, Github-actions.So join in this Friday to an exciting meetup/talk.

A person whose silence speaks volumes, became the most followed TikToker in June 2022.Contrary to the popular 'trying too hard' behaviour that has taken over present day pop culture, his authenticity is quite appealing and debunks or mocks the overproduced trends that happen across social media.In August 2021, Lame appeared as a co-star for Juventus F.C.'s announcement of Manuel Locatelli. His exasperation is quite universal and emotions are relatable. His skyrocketing to stardom shone an unfavourable spotlight on\u00a0Italy\u2019s very strict citizenship rules. He represents the idea that hard work and determination gets you far in life. Even though he got layed off during the pandemic cutoffs, he didn't give up and continued making tiktok videos which later became a global sensation. Subsequently he was granted with Italian citizenship in August 2022.Kudos to him on his hard work, determination and go getting attitude \ud83d\udc4f",

In our day-to-day life it gives us an insight in the root causes for thoughts thus giving us the upper hand in handling situations.

After her father's death, Lata Mangeshkar was mentored by Ghulam Haider, who believed in her talent and singing. According to Lata, Haider showed complete faith in her talent. She even considered him as her Godfather.Apart from providing the people with masterpieces in the entertainment media, she brought the nation to tears, including the prime minister after singing the song \"Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo\" against the backdrop of Sino-Indian War in 1963. In 1974, she became the first Indian to perform at Royal Albert Hall, London. She\u00a0has\u00a0received\u00a0numerous\u00a0honours,\u00a0including\u00a0the\u00a0Padma\u00a0Bhushan,\u00a0Dadasaheb\u00a0Phalke\u00a0Award,\u00a0Padma\u00a0Vibhushan,\u00a0and\u00a0Bharat\u00a0Ratna.Even the Late Dilip Kumar once commented \"Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain\" that translates to \"Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God\".

At that time, Justice Chakraborty, who was then the acting Governor of Bengal, had a prolonged discussion regarding the fundamental factors that had led the British to quit India. We want to quote their conversation here as told by Justice Chakraborty, who had written a letter to the publisher of RC Majumdar's book, A History of Bengal, in which he wrote:\"My direct question to Attlee was that since Gandhi's Quit India Movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they have to leave?In his reply, Attlee cited several reasons, the main among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British crown among the Indian Army and Navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji.No words or paragraphs can describe the work and contribution of Netaji Bose in our freedom struggle.",

Born in 1924 in Gwalior, he was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected to Lok Sabha a total of 10 times and also to Rajya Sabha twice. He steered India through the rough coalition years of the Indian democracy and served as the PM not only once, but first for a period of 13 days, then 13 months, finally followed by a full five-year term. Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is known today for the Pokhran II nuclear tests which made India a full-fledged nuclear power and the glorious victory in the Kargil War of 1999. But very few people know that he was also a poet and a scholar. His speech possessed such articulation skills that even opposition leaders couldn\u2019t help but toe their own party lines to support him. He was a true patriot and reformer and dreamt of a shining India, a dream shared by million others. Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has left an indelible mark on Indian politics, and the ideals that he stood for and the principles he upheld still continue to inspire us.",

Even if he was jailed many times, it didn't dissuade him from his motive. Patel's primary motivation was to expel the British out of the country. His patriotism for the country was strong and fierce. Sardar Vallabhai Patel was an independent and motivated man. He completed all his professional endeavors with close to no help from other people. Sardar Vallabhai Patel was one of the people who contributed to bringing the people of the country together. He empowered people to fight against the British authorities. The Iron Man of India is a freedom fighter of the country. He was a part of many protests against the authorities in India. Patel joined Mahatma Gandhi in the Satyagraha in Gujarat and became a part of the Quit India Movement. He joined the Indian National Congress and became of the vital party members of the party. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel inspired the people of the country in many ways. He was a self-made man because he didn't depend on anyone for any reason. Patel was one of the most beloved leaders of the country because he connected with the people. He brought the people of the country together. After Independence his role in the Indian political front increased. He was elected as the Home Minister of India, and later, he was elected as the Deputy Prime Minister of India. He became the first person to be selected for both positions. He played a significant role in bringing the country together. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the main force who integrated the states of India. He was a firm believer in the One Nation Theory, which resulted in the formation of India's rules.",

Our generation grew up watching Ganesha in childhood movies and cartoons, and a lot of us hold him in affection. The books contains a lot of pictures of Ganesha's depictions in architecture and scriptures and it's very interesting to note just how many lives have been touched by Ganesha's legacy .The book is actually a multidimensional study of Ganesha's impact on the people, leaning it more towards sociology than religion. It's an informative book, so we wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for preaching or self help. However, those interested in reading about the history, legends and stories associated with Ganesha, along with archeological evidences of his devotees thrown in will find this book a perfect match.\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udde1#GaneshaChaturthi #Festival #LordGanesha #Books #BookReview #jiit #Pts",

Hence we should protect the future of our country and provide them with a well-rounded education so that they can lead this country to the path of success.This is a special day that reminds us that children are the building blocks of the nation and deserve the proper education and opportunities to lead our country in the right direction and make it more prosperous.Happy Children\u2019s Day!Caption credits: @_.pinaki",

We all grew up hearing the age-old story. When Lord Krishna told the people of Mathura to worship Govardhan Hill, as it provided them and their cattle with food and resources, it angered Lord Indra. As a punishment, he made it rain for 7 days straight. To save the people, Lord Krishna raised Govardhan Parvat on his finger to provide shelter to the people. The day he dropped the mountain back after Lord Indra apologized, marks the day we all know and celebrate as Govardhan Puja. It is also called \u201cAnnakut\u201d or the day their food bearing mountain was saved.On this day, people worship Lord Krishna, Goddess Annapurna (the goddess of food) as well as the holy cow. Traditionally, 56 types of foods are prepared this day and the gods are served first. Cows are garlanded and idols of Lord Krishna are made. People also keep pots full of different kinds of food grains.",

It is believed that Lord Krishna was born in the era when there was darkness and evil all around. The day symbolises that one ray of hope which signifies that there can be no evil greater than the good and eventually the malignant will have to surrender on the birth of the benevolent . So, let us all burn the evil inside us at midnight and welcome the tranquillity and appearance of Lord Krishna inside us! Wishing everyone a very happy Janmashtami.",

This book takes up several examples to illustrate what is being preached by the author. Also, the book allows one to retrospect his/her actions and helps them find hope.We believe that this pandemic is pushing all of our's limits and has affected millions of people's mental health, thus it was high time we helped you all find a read that is worth your time and suitable to the situation.Hoping every single one of you is doing Fine.\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab#ThePageTurnerSociety #Books #JIIT #PTS #hope #MarkManson #BookAboutHope #HappyReading #HappyThoughts #Reading #Retrospection",

What makes the movie work is the spectacular comic timing and performances of the lead actors.

Let us help \ud83d\ude0eIt's always hard to suggest an anime to a crowd where there are people who never have watched anything of this sort. And when it comes to comedy anime we all go to Shin-chan, one of the greatest shows (and we agree with it too \ud83d\ude1d), but for you all, we dived a little deeper and found something that is a classic and falls in the same league. \"Kochikame\" is our choice for this month's anime binge.This anime will surely take us back in time and we promise it isn't going to be a scary one a beautiful one with a nostalgic touch to it. The story is about the life of a police officer Ryotsu working at a police station. The unique character selection coupled with the officers' bizarre synergy turns each episode into an intriguing and hilarious watch.So what are you waiting for? Let us live this April in Kochikame's era. See you all with the next recommendation.....#ThePageTurnerSociety #JIIT #PTS #Anime #AnimeLove #kochikame #kochikameforever #Classic #Funmy #humor #ryotsu",

Now this gives us a good idea about how many authors are there in this field making it one of the most difficult tasks to pick up the author of the month in the area of suspense and thriller fiction. After reading the books of one of such quickly rising authors we found him - \"Blake Crouch\".Yes people we have chosen Blake as our Author of the Month and rightly so as his books have already been adapted into TV series and currently his book Dark Matter is being picturized by Sony Pictures. Blake started his career with 2 novels in 2004 and 2005 but what established him as a mystery author was his Wayward Pines Trilogy in 2012-14. Coming to his writing style, he is one of the best handlers of built-ups in books. When you start reading him, the beginning won't make sense but what would will amaze is you won't be able to keep Blake's book down and turns out it is the case all around the world. He weaves the story with such sophistication that the  person reading it is attached to it. They say- \"The historian records, but the novelist creates\" and trust us this what this author creates is worth recording.

Let me ask you this :Are You Happy With Your Life?? Whatever your answer might be, it is assured that this book, DARK MATTER by Blake Crouch, will make you happy not just because it a real pageturner but it does answer the question posed by Robert Frost in The Road not Taken.This book has a tinge of everything with loads and loads of thrill and it surely reminds us of Dan Brown. The story revolves around the protagonist, a physics professor, who one day wakes up in a world where he is not an ordinary man. He is to identify if that's a dream or some other reality of his world and must find his way back to his wife and son. We all are aware of the great thrillers written by S. Sheldon, Agatha Christie, or Lee Child but it has been long since a new style from a budding author came out that had everyone glued to it and kept those pages turning by themselves till there were no more to go on.

A beautiful spot , maybe on a yacht. All heart wants is to answer the call from the hills. To complete the hardest summits and get those satisfying chills. To experience the sun giving nature it's daily refills. All heart wants is to play with the waves,trying to catch one and let the other slip away. To explore the mystery inside the caves , searching for the inner self and giving negativity a castaway. All the heart wants is a cabin by the lake, with the heartthrob by your side giving you the sweet headache. All the heart wants is to travel to a thousand strange places, to extract the very essence of nature and all it's beautiful faces.

It is mainly because Shiva is traditionally associated with Tamas, which represents night or darkness. Shiva is their source, but he does not have them. He is Shivam, means the purest. The darkness of tamas cannot reside in him, but he presides over it as its controller and lord. Thus, Shivaratri, or the night of Shiva, has symbolic significance. Shiva is the lord of the materiality of the universe. In the microcosm of a living being, he is the lord of the mind and body. Both are enveloped in darkness.Happy Maha Shivaratri \ud83d\udd31",
